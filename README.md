# ALX Listing App

## About the Project
The **ALX Listing App** project aims to scaffold and lay the foundational structure for a modern Airbnb clone. This milestone focuses on setting up a well-organized and scalable codebase using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint**. By establishing a clean folder structure, reusable components, and organized assets, the project provides a solid starting point for building a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly property listing page.
